# maim - make image (take screenshots)

- need to either redirect output, or specify output file:
`maim | {{...}}`
`maim {{output-file}}`

- take screenshot of entire screen:
`maim`

- take screenshot of only a selection:
`(-s|--select)`

- click twice to indicate a selection, rather than dragging:
`(-D|--nodrag)`
(but the cursor was partially shown in the resulting screenshot when I tested it...)
