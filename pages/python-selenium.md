Automate browser interactions.

- 2021-04-25: I had a lot of pain with Firefox, a lot less with Chrome. (Firefox:Â many commands that should have worked didn't, and the error message I was stuck on for a long time wasn't clear enough. Chrome worked much better and gave a much better error message).

- on Arch Linux, the Chrome web driver is already included with the chromium package.
